## Workshop guidelines

- **Workshop will be recorded.** We will make our best effort to respect the privacy of participants. Chat will not be recorded. 

.pull-left[
- **Help** is always available.
  - Use the Zoom chat (private or public) to ask a question.
  - Raise your hand `r emo::ji('raised_back_of_hand')`.
  - And you can always un-mute and ask.

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

## ggplot2 $\in$ tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```

.pull-right[
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package
- The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics
- It is inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson
]

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic.

- What are the functions doing the plotting? 
- What is the dataset being plotted? 
- Which variable is on the x-axis and which variable is on the y-axis? 
- What does the warning mean?

What does `geom_smooth()` do?

## Hello ggplot2!

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2 
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

# Visualizing Star Wars

## Dataset terminology

- Each row is an **observation**
- Each column is a **variable**

## Additional variables

We can map additional variables to various features of the plot:

- aesthetics
    - shape
    - colour
    - fill
    - size
    - alpha (transparency)
- faceting: small multiples displaying different subsets

---

class: middle

# Aesthetics

---

## Aesthetics options

Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable**
in the data are

- `color`
- `size`
- `fill`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

---

## Mass vs. height + gender

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Mass vs. height + gender

```{r out.width="65%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, 
                     size = birth_year)) + #<<
  geom_point()
```

---

## Fix it up!

.midi[
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass, 
                     color = gender, 
                     size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "by gender and birth year",
       x = "Height (cm)", 
       y = "Weight (kg)",
       color = "Gender",
       size = "Birth year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.direction = "horizontal", 
        legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.box = "vertical")
```
]

---

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5,fig.width=8}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass, 
                     color = gender, 
                     size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "by gender and birth year",
       x = "Height (cm)", 
       y = "Weight (kg)",
       color = "Gender",
       size = "Birth year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.direction = "horizontal", 
        legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.box = "vertical")
```

---

## Mass vs. height + gender

Let's now increase the size of all points *not* based on the values of a 
variable in the data, i.e. **set** size instead of **map** size:

.midi[
```{r out.width="63%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) #<<
```
]

---

## Aesthetics summary

- Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

aesthetics    | discrete                 | continuous
------------- | ------------------------ | ------------
color         | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size          | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value
shape         | different shape for each | *shouldn't (and doesn't) work*

- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable, define the 
features in the geom for customization **not** mapped to a variable

# Faceting

---

## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

---

```{r fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "Faceted by gender")  #<<
```

---

.your-turn[
Look through the next three slides titled Facet 1, 2, and 3 describe what each plot displays. Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots. But you should always label your plots!

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00)
```

---

### Facet 1

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(gender ~ .)
```

---

### Facet 2

```{r fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender)
```

---

### Facet 3

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ eye_color)
```

---

## Facet summary

- `facet_grid()`: 
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped into 2d

# Identifying variables

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively. 
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering. R uses the term 
**factor** for most categorical data.
